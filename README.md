# Project Overview

This repository contains the project that earned me my DataCamp Professional [certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0028934332278). In this project, I analyzed sales data from the company Pens and Printers.

Pens and Printers supplies high-quality office products, ranging from pens and notebooks to desk chairs and monitors, to large organizations. Although they do not manufacture their products, they specialize in selling items produced by other companies.

The company's focus is on providing tools that help customers enhance creativity and brainstorming. They recently launched a new line of office stationery and tested three different sales strategies: targeted emails, phone calls, and a combination of both.

**Email:** Customers in this group received an initial email when the product line launched, followed by another email three weeks later. This method required minimal effort from the sales team.

**Call:** Customers were contacted by a sales team member, with each call averaging around thirty minutes per customer.

**Email and Call:** Customers first received an email with product information and were subsequently called a week later. The initial email required little effort, while the follow-up call averaged ten minutes per customer.

The executive team sought an analysis of the effectiveness of these sales approaches for the new product line. They needed insights on:

- The number of customers reached by each approach.
- The overall and method-specific revenue distribution.
- Differences in revenue over time for each sales strategy.
- Recommendations on the most effective method, considering the time investment required from the sales team.
- Any additional insights into differences between customer groups that could inform future strategies.

The successful completion of this project and certification demonstrate my ability to deliver actionable insights and data-driven recommendations.
